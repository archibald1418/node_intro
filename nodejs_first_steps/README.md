# What the heck is node.JS ???

Node.js is not a language, but a runtime that allows JS to be run on a server.

Before 2013, they used to run PHP, Python, Java, Ruby etc. on the server. Then came Node.JS, which allowed to write fullstack web applications using only JS. 

### Node Runtime

node js globals:
